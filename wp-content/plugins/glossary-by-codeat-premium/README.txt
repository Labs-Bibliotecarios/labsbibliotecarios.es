Improve your UX & SEO with Codeat's Glossary: a powerful auto-link engine; customizable styled tooltips, mobile settings, and much more!

== Description ==

Adding a glossary to your website can be a smart move to improve your users' reading experience and significantly improve SEO and rankings.
If you’re looking for the ultimate glossary plugin for your WordPress site, look no further: you’ve found it!

Glossary by Codeat is the freemium WordPress plugin that allows you to create a glossary for your website and turn your content into a complete and navigable resource. It comes with a free and a PRO version.
 == What is the superpower of Glossary by Codeat? ===

The Glossary plugin automatically creates word lists from your content and generates the corresponding styled tooltips.
The terms and definitions will be grouped in a glossary or dictionary section and automatically linked to the corresponding words within your posts and pages.

You can use Glossary by Codeat with the classic WordPress editor or with Gutenberg: it’s 100% compatible.

==== Need some examples? ====

Let’s say you have a food blog.
How great would it be to show your readers a tooltip (and a direct link) to the description of an ingredient (or kitchen utensil) without them having to leave your website?

And what if you run an online store selling fishing gear?
With the Glossary plugin, you can provide detailed descriptions of your merchandise and suggest related products directly from your store's pages.

Are you a big fan of Back to the Future and want to create a digital encyclopedia that covers all aspects of your favorite saga?
With Glossary by Codeat, it's a piece of cake! [See this demo](https://demo.codeat.co/glossary/).

==== Are you an affiliate marketing specialist? ====

You can use Glossary by Codeat to include your affiliation URLs and descriptions to some of your key terms. This way, you can turn the tooltip area of the pop-up into a revenue machine! Cool, uh?

And what’s even cooler is that you can use Glossary by Codeat for free!
**The basic version of Glossary is – and will always be – free.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is the documentation available? =

Of course!
[Our extensive documentation covers](http://docs.codeat.co/glossary/getting-started/) all the features and tips to make the most of the Glossary plugin.

= Does it support all languages and alphabets? =

Yes, Glossary is designed to work in any language. It currently supports RTL and LTR alphabets as well as non-latin fonts.

At the time of writing, we have tested it internally with Hebrew, Arabic, German, Japanese, Cherokee, Russian, and Greek.
We welcome all feedback on these and other languages.

= Can I use it with ACF? =

Yes! If you own a Premium Glossary license, you can use our plugin with ACF.

Glossary will add a checkbox on ACF labeled as Add support for Glossary in your fields.

This way, you will be able to activate the filtering in ACF for customizing your fields.

= Is it compatible with Genesis? =

Yes, we love the Genesis Framework, and we care about Genesis fans.

The SEO, Layout, and Archive sections are fully integrated.

= Is it compatible with cache plugins? =

Yes, Glossary works with both backend and frontend caching.
Caching can be applied by a WordPress plugin and/or by your host: whatever the case, you don’t have to worry about compatibility.

If you’re using a backend caching plugin, the cache is refreshed every few hours or every day at most, so this won’t pose any problem with Glossary.

On the other hand, if you’re using front-end caching and Glossary Premium, you should take a few extra measures. Every time you edit your settings, for example, you change your tooltips' style, you need to clear your frontend cache.

The way you clear the cache may vary according to the plugin or hosting you’re using, so please refer to their documentation to learn how to do it.

= Is it compatible with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes!
If you're running a Multisite install and managing multiple websites, Glossary can automatically serve all the network websites where our plugin is active.

To work in this environment, the Glossary plugin requires two elements:

* One license per domain (or one license for the subdomain).
* Multisite with a shared database.

[Read our documentation for more details](http://docs.codeat.co/glossary/faq/).

= Is it compatible with translation plugins? =

Yes, Glossary is 100% compatible with **WPML** and **Polylang**.

To make them work together, you will have to set the language in each post type where you wish to execute Glossary.
In this way, our plugin will recognize the terms and will manage the respective descriptions accordingly.

[Read our documentation for more details](http://docs.codeat.co/glossary/faq/).

= Does it support Visual Composer? =

Most of the time, yes, it does.

On the other hand, there are dozens of Visual Composer plugins in the WordPress ecosystem, and a large amount of them don’t behave in a standard way, which can represent an issue.

The most common problem you might encounter with Visual Composer is the truncation of your tooltips.

[Read our documentation for more details](http://docs.codeat.co/glossary/faq/).
